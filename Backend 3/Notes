EJS

Templating

EJS(Embedded Javascript Templates)

Ejs is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML Markup with plain JAVASCRIPT.

With EJS we can create HTML markup templates in which we can write javascript code too


Chapter 4 - 
Interpolation Syntax 

Interpolatio refers to embedding expressios into marked up text.

we can use tags to perform specific tasks these tags are

<%    'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_   ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%=    Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%-    Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%#    Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%%    Outputs a literal '<%'
%>     Plain ending tag
-%>    Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
_%>    ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it


EJS Conditional Statements

Adding Conditions inside EJS

alright now this is interesting we can see how js with returning html elements works in ejs. so whatever part is the js code we have to enclose it inside the <% %> tag and html will be written as it is... 

Lets take an example

this is the simple js code with html 

if(diceRoll == 6) {
    <h1> Good Job there ! </h1>
}

however we dont write it like above we write it like below

<% if(diceRoll == 6) {  %>
    <h1> Good Job there ! </h1>
<% } %>



Loops in EJS

<% for (let x of followers) { %>
    <h4 style="display: inline-block"><%= x %></h4>
    <% } %>

added data.json file because data will will be incoming in json format so we must know how to deal with the data coming in json format.
now we will remove all the manually typed data and use the data.json file to import data dynamically.



Serving Static Files
there should be a public folder in our file strructure in order to add css and js files and in those folder should remai the css and js file

syntax is 

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"public")));
