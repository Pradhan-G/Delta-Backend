How to Run JS files in node ?
    -- Make sure you are in teh correct directory
    -- lets say the name is script.js 
    -- to run it we will use the command "node script.js"


Process 
    process - This object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.
    process.argv - returns an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the node.js process was launched. Ex - node script.js hello bye


module.exports is used to export data from one file to another. it can be a string, Number, function, variable anything;
we use the require() function  to accept the incoming information.
if we use the require() function  without actually exporting anything .. we will get an empty object.
