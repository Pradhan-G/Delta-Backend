What is Node.js ?
 -- not a language,library or framework.
 -- Javascript Runtime Environment.
 -- It is used for server side Programming.

After Installing node.js we can use "node" command to start the runtime Environment.
we can use .help command to know more about the commands.

How to Run JS files in node ?
    -- Make sure you are in teh correct directory
    -- lets say the name is script.js 
    -- to run it we will use the command "node script.js"


Process 
    process - This object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.
    process.argv - returns an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the node.js process was launched. Ex - node script.js hello bye


module.exports is used to export data from one file to another. it can be a string, Number, function, variable anything;
we use the require() function  to accept the incoming information.
if we use the require() function  without actually exporting anything .. we will get an empty object.


Now we will learn how can we transfer whole directories information as objects to a file in some other directory.
    -- first after all the files with has been created, we have to create an index.js(the naming convention matters here) file in the same directory where all the data is stored and then require every data over there.

    -- now we can directly use the Folder name or directory name to access the data that we are exporting from the index.js file in that folder.
