Library vs Framework

A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks eg - axios

a Framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications eg - express

What is express ?

a Node.js web application framework that helps us to make web applications
It is used for server side programming

1. listen for incoming request
2. parse the data
3. match response with routes
4. sends the response

steps to create a server side express js app.

first we need to go to the desired location and do the npm init command.
next we need to install express in the folder using npm i express command.
Now we need to create the indexl.js app so and this js app will be the gateway for server side rendering .

then we need to require the express package and call it agai because it will return a value

How to send a response ?

To send a response we can use the app.send() method
app.use((req, res) => {
console.log("Request received");
res.send("This is a basic response");
});

There are some important methods in this that we need to talk about

    req.query

will contain the search query that we provide with the url.

    req.params

will contain the the varaible values that we provide with the url.

    res.send()

will send the data to the user in form of HTML data, string, number. usually used to give the response of the req.

    app.get

used to define the routes and the what happen when the user enters the route.

app.get("/:username/:id", (req, res) => {
res.send("We can also store data in variables that we will pass.");
let { username, id } = req.params;
});

app.get("/search", (req, res) => {
console.log(req.query);
res.send("No Results yet");
});

app.get("/apple", (req, res) => {
res.send("You are at the apple Path");
});
